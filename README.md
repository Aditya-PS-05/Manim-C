**Manim-C** is a high-performance animation engine inspired by [3Blue1Brown's Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), designed for creating mathematical visualizations with simplicity and efficiency. Written entirely in **C**, it focuses on speed, extensibility, and minimalist code to create custom animations for educational content, presentations, and research.
